## description of the project

Our first idea is a web site or a mobile app, called (hi service)introduction.
Our app will help people to find a nearby service or profession, so as a user I have small issue in My house electricity, so I will open the app and I will search for house electrician, the app will give me live location for the nearest electrician with all details, and phone number and his rating , so the user can call him and the can decide ,
We can put all type of profession, plumber, teacher, car mechanic, tailor etc…
And we can put also other services with live location and fixed location,
Like car washing station we can add fixed location for these station.
•    So for the app implementation will have first a database to save all users, and we can sign up and login in the web site
•    And you have to put all your details also with your fixed location , and we can access to your live location
•    So on our sign up route you can choose to sign up as normal user that looking for profession or service:
•    And the service or profession provider can sign up as different role
•    So we will use basic Auth. and bearer Auth., and ACL .
